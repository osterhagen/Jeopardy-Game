## Summary
Jeopardy Through History, an online Jeopardy with a nice minimalistic design that allows people to test their knowledge with a database of over 1000 of jeopardy's most famous questions. 
## Technologies
Done with EJS(HTML/CSS) for clientside,  Node/Express JS for the server, and SQLite for the Database.
The database, JeopardyGame.db/Jeopardy.db, was taken from our work in CS390 WAP, while all of the front end scritping, server architecture, and buisness logic was done in this class for our project with assistance of some boostrap libraries and w3 modal intitalization.

*** The database we have used is not clean (has junk or null values) and so we have purposefully bottlenecked our program for effciency and accuracy ***
