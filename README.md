## Summary
Jeopardy Game, an online Jeopardy with a nice minimalistic design that allows people to test their knowledge with a database of over 1000 jeopardy questions, along with the ability to add questions on their own.
## Technologies
Done with HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) for Frontend Design,  Node/Express JS for the server, and SQLite for the Database.
The database, JeopardyGame.db/Jeopardy.db, was taken from our work in CS390 WAP, while all of the front end scritping and buisness logic was done in this class for our project with assistance of some boostrap libraries
